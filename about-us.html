							<h4>Biography</h4>
								<p>
									Hi!👋 I'm Xinru Xue, an undergraduate student pursuing dual degrees in Internet of Things Engineering at <strong>Hebei University of Technology</strong> and Computer Science at <strong>Massey University</strong>. I have hands-on experience in IoT, cloud systems, embedded devices, AI model deployment, and game development.
								</p>

								<p>
                                    I was born in an industrial town in northern China. In the memories of our parents' generation, this was once a desolate land forgotten by time—<strong>where endless reed marshes swayed in the autumn wind, and silver-white saline-alkali soil stretched like scars across the earth to the horizon</strong>.
                                    Yet it was precisely on this barren ground that <strong>our parents forged their youth into shovels and poured their dreams into concrete</strong>. With calloused hands, they raised the first steel beams; with sweat-drenched backs, they carried the weight of an entire era.
                                    <strong>The roar of concrete mixers in the deep night became their lullaby for the dawn; the sparks of molten steel that scorched their skin were the stars they ignited for this land</strong>. Today, as morning light bathes the new streets, as ginkgo leaves drift against school windows,
                                    <strong>what we see is not just a rising city, but a monument cast with youth and fervor</strong>—every inch of soil steeped in the tears and laughter of the preceding generation, every street echoing with the resolute footsteps of that fiery age.
								</p>

								<p>
									Since middle school, I have demonstrated a strong interest in computer science. I learned multiple programming languages including <strong>C</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>, and <strong>Python</strong>, and served as president of the computer club. In my spare time, I volunteered to troubleshoot and repair computers for classmates and teachers.
								</p>

								<p>
									During middle school, I achieved <strong>outstanding academic results</strong>, earning straight A's in all final examinations. In 2020, I was admitted to <strong>Dagang Oilfield Experimental Middle School</strong> in Tianjin, scoring <strong>556.1 out of 590 (94.3%)</strong>. This institution is recognized as <strong>one of Tianjin's first municipal key high schools</strong> and <strong>one of the city's first model high schools</strong>.
								</p>

								<p>
									During high school, I continued serving as president of the computer club, organizing multiple computer science events. I also co-founded <strong>Tianjin Nansu Technology Co., Ltd.</strong> with friends, focusing on web design, software development, and cryptocurrency computing. As of 2025, the company had a registered capital of <strong>1 million RMB</strong>.
								</p>

								<p>
									I also served as an early technical co-founder at a company, responsible for network architecture design, hardware assembly and maintenance, Ethereum mining rig configuration, and 3D game development using Unreal Engine 4.
								</p>

								<p>
									In 2023, I participated in the National College Entrance Examination and was admitted to the dual-degree program between <strong>Hebei University of Technology</strong> and <strong>Massey University</strong>, scoring <strong>613 out of 750 (82%)</strong>, continuing my studies in computer science. During my undergraduate studies, I ranked in the <strong>top 15%</strong> of my cohort and received the Third-Class Academic Scholarship at the Hebei University of Technology (Finnish Campus) for the 2023–2024 academic year. I actively participated in scientific research and innovation competitions, such as the <strong>American Mathematical Modeling Contest (MCM/ICM)</strong>, the <strong>National College Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program</strong>, and the <strong>Challenge Cup Special Competition</strong>. I was also a finalist in the <strong>Provincial Electrical and Electronic Engineering Innovation Competition</strong> and successfully entered the <strong>National College English Competition</strong> finals.
								</p>

								<p>
									In addition to academics, I actively engaged in <strong>student leadership</strong> and <strong>cross-cultural activities</strong>. I served in multiple roles within the <strong>student union</strong> and class committees, organizing events such as 'May of Blossoms', 'Mid-Autumn Lecture', and 'International Chinese Language Day', which enhanced <strong>team collaboration</strong> and <strong>event coordination skills</strong>. These experiences also strengthened my ability to communicate in <strong>multicultural environments</strong> and lead collaborative projects. Furthermore, I developed strong technical skills in <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>embedded systems</strong>, and <strong>cloud computing</strong>, and gained hands-on experience in <strong>AI model deployment</strong> and <strong>IoT engineering</strong>. I am passionate about integrating technology with real-world scenarios and continuously exploring innovative solutions.
								</p>

								<p>
									During my undergraduate studies, I actively applied my knowledge in real-world environments. I served as a <strong>Technical Co-founder</strong> at Tianjin Nansu Technology, where I built <strong>enterprise network systems</strong>, maintained <strong>hardware infrastructure</strong>, and participated in <strong>3D game development and system optimization</strong>. I also worked as an <strong>Operations & Maintenance Intern</strong> at Bohai Drilling and CNPC Dagang Oilfield, gaining hands-on experience in <strong>large-scale digital platforms and IT support</strong>. In addition, I served as a <strong>CS Assistant Lecturer</strong>, delivering <strong>C programming lectures and lab sessions</strong>, grading assignments, and supporting student learning—further strengthening both my <strong>technical depth and communication skills</strong>.
								</p>

								<p>
									📍 Currently exploring <strong>IoT, cloud solutions, embedded systems, and AI deployment</strong>, with the goal of <strong>integrating software and hardware to develop innovative solutions</strong>.
